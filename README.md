## LangChain Applications
This part demonstrates LangChain's versatility in natural language processing. It integrates language models (LLMs) with prompts, parsers, and memory to perform tasks efficiently. From basic LLM invocations to complex workflows involving structured output parsing and sequential chaining, the script showcases diverse functionalities. Advanced features like multi-prompt routers enhance flexibility in handling inputs. LangChain empowers developers to create sophisticated conversational AI systems tailored to specific needs, offering a comprehensive solution for building robust applications.

## PDF Agent
The code demonstrates LangChain's use for document processing and question answering. It loads PDFs, splits them, and generates embeddings. It compares document retrieval methods using FAISS and Pinecone. It integrates an LLM from HuggingFaceHub for question answering and retrieval chains for sourcing relevant documents.
